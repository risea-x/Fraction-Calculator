## A program in Java that lets users perform arithmetic operations with integers, fractions, and decimal numbers.

This program implemented The <strong>Model-View-Controller (MVC)</strong> design pattern. It is a software architecture pattern that separates an
application's data model, user interface, and control logic into three separate components, each with its own defined responsibilities:

- <em>Model:</em> The model represents the application's data and business logic, and provides an interface for interacting with and manipulating that data.
In an MVC application, the model is responsible for managing the data, performing any necessary calculations or transformations, and notifying the
view and controller of any changes.

- <em>View:</em> The view represents the application's user interface, and is responsible for displaying the data and receiving user input.
In an MVC application, the view is responsible for rendering the data provided by the model, and sending any user input back
to the controller for processing.

- <em>Controller:</em> The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, and is responsible for interpreting user input and manipulating
the model or view accordingly. In an MVC application, the controller is responsible for receiving user input from the view,
updating the model based on that input, and updating the view to reflect any changes in the model.
